# wordpress-nav-to-json
Creates a JSON file of our Wordpress site's navigation menu structure. Activating this plugin will give you the abiltiy and functionality to publish Wordpress menus in a JSON file and structure.

## How it works
### Step 1
Install and activate the plugin in your Wordpress environment.

### Step 2
Create your Wordpress navigation menus within the Appearance -> Menu. Clicking "Save Menu" will automatically generate a JSON file of all of your menus saved.

### Step 3
Make a request to your nav menu file. The JSON file of your nav is stored in a public folder within this plugin's directory. More or less, the path will look like so: [Your site].com/wp-content/plugins/anaplan-nav-menu-json/assets/public/anaplan-main-menu.json
